# A Thousand Ways to Die: World Data

# Group 4 Project One


## Description

#### What are the leading causes of death in the world? Which Countries have the highest mortality rates? Why is this the case? These are all questions that motivate our project. We built this to analyze different socio-economic conditions and Healthcare Index to determine if they have any impact on the high mortality rates in particular areas. 


### Graphs and Charts that support our findings:

#### - A Map to Show Locations of Deaths Around the World
#### - A Bar Chart to show Causes of Death over the Years
#### - A Scatter plot of healthcare index vs Healthcare Spending
#### - A Scatter plot of healthcare index vs total death rate


## Data Process and Challenges 

#### - We started by cleaning both of our chosen datasets and visualized them using charts. Next, we merged both datasets together to start and make connections. Then, we plotted our graphs to show the correlation between healthcare spending and total life expectancy. We also wanted to visually show bar charts of the leading causes of death in the countries with the highest death rate and with the lowest death rate.

### - Challenges 

#### - Trying to rename columns and merging the data 
#### - Trying to get the bar chart stacked correctly 
#### - Cleaning and narrowing down the data

## Observations

#### - Saw a positive correlation with total life expectancy and the healthcare index
#### - Saw a positive correlation with total life expectancy and overall health spending
#### - As healthcare spending got higher, so did the healthcare index
